# react-photo-gallery

A photo gallery made with the PERN stack.

The images are statically hosted, with URLs and "likes" stored in the database. The user can like a photo, which updates the database.

# Future Improvements

I'd like to add the ability to upload new photos and have them cropped automatically.

# Install

`yarn && yarn run client-install`

# Config

Add a `.env` file with a `DB_URI` value for a Postgres connection string.

# Dev

`yarn run dev`
