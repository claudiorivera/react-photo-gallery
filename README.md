# react-photo-gallery

A photo gallery made with the PERN stack, which was made for a homework assignment.

The images are statically hosted, with URLs and likes stored in the database. The user can like a photo, which updates the database.

# Future Improvements

I'd like to add the ability to upload new photos and have them cropped automatically.
